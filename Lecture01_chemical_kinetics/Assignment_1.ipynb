First we will look into simple unimolecular and bimolecular reactions, we will use scipy.integrate.ode_int() on these problems aswell to see how close they are to the analytical solutions. Then we will go into more complicated mechnisms that cannot be solved analytically and compare to experimental data. To estimate kinetic parameters\r\n","\r\n","As a first excersize, define functions for the unimolecular and bimolecular reactions as given in the introducary documents and plot both concentrations in time, use k1 = 0.1 s$^{-1}$ and k2 = 50 s$^{-1}$ M$^{-1}$ and initial concentrations 10 mM. Make sure to go the a time where the reaction is complete i.e. the concentrations don't change anymore\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ch2SlztxRb1q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612182662546,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1101,"user":{"displayName":"A.S.
